            <h3>HTML Project 1</h3>
            <p style="color: purple; font-size: large;">
                I'm currently working on an HTML project focused on creating a well-structured personal portfolio.
                <br>The project involves designing a Projects section, where each project is showcased with a title,
                <br>description, and a link to the project's GitHub repository. This section is crafted using semantic HTML tags ensuring that the content is both organized and accessible.
                <br>This hands-on experience is helping me improve my front-end development skills and understand the importance of clean, maintainable code.

            <h3>HTML Project 2</h3>
            <p style="color: purple; font-size: large;">
                I'm currently working on an HTML project centered around a book review platform. This involves
                <br>designing a user-friendly interface where visitors can explore categorized book reviews with detailed
                <br>summaries, critiques, and recommendations. Using HTML5 and CSS, I aim to create an accessible and
                <br>visually appealing experience that enhances readers' engagement with diverse literary works.
                <br>This project not only strengthens my front-end development skills but also emphasizes the value of crafting informative content for literary enthusiasts.

            <h3>HTML Project 3</h3>
            <p style="color: purple; font-size: large;">
                I am currently immersed in an HTML project focused on documenting the History of Adwa. This
                <br>project delves into the rich historical events and significance of the Battle of Adwa, highlighting its
                <br>cultural, political, and social impacts. Through structured HTML elements like headings, paragraphs,
                <br>and possibly multimedia content, I aim to create an engaging narrative that educates and informs
                <br>visitors about this pivotal moment in Ethiopian and African history. This endeavor not only enhances
                <br>my HTML skills but also deepens my appreciation for historical storytelling and digital presentation.
